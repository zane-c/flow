## Flow - Project 3 - CS198

Flow is a 2D puzzle game where you use simple building blocks to direct bouncing balls to their
correct bins. Dealing with gravity, friction, collision and the randomness of this physics simulation quickly turns any level into a Rube-Golderberg style machine. Can you make it to the 
last stage with at least one ball left?
